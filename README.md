## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. I learned about the `text-indent` property, which is used to specify the indentation of the first line in a text block.
2. I gained knowledge about media queries and their application for responsive design. In this project, a media query is utilized to adjust styles based on the screen width.
3. I discovered the use of the ::marker pseudo-element to style the marker of list items. In this case, the color of the marker is customized for better visual presentation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css/reference) - This helped me in understanding `text-indent` property and `::marker` pseudo-element.
